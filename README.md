# Business Reviews System

A Python recreation of the Yelp website which allows users to view restaurant reviews and make reviews themselves. The data, which comes from Yelp's public dataset, is stored in a MongoDB database and replicated and sharded in sharded clusters on AWS EC2 instances. Users can create accounts and determine their access level in the program. The software stack includes MongoDB for the DBMS, Python for the application, and Pymongo for the driver.
